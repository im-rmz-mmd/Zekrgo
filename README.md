ðŸŽ¯ When a Joke Turned into a Program!

One night, we were joking around in a group chat, having fun as usual. But then, in a perfectly coordinated operation, we pranked one of our friends a little too hard. The result? He got upset and left the group! ðŸ˜‚

I felt kinda bad and thought, "I need to make it up to him somehow." ðŸ¥°
Then, out of nowhere, an idea struck meâ€”one that no one saw coming:
A program that shows daily Islamic supplications! ðŸ˜‚

ðŸ¤– What Did I Build? 

A simple yet unique program!

Using Tkinter, I created an app that:

ðŸ”¸ Has 7 buttons, each labeled with a day of the week.

text = "Day of the Week" 

ðŸ”¹ Clicking a button opens a messagebox displaying the supplication for that day.

messagebox.showinfo("Supplication of the Day", "Supplication Text") 

ðŸ”¸ There's also a red exit button to close the app, because obviously, we need a way out!

command = x.destroy 

ðŸ”¹ At the bottom, I added a signature labelâ€”my GitHub linkâ€”so anyone using it knows who the genius behind this is! ðŸ¥°

Label(text="GitHub: my_link_here") ðŸ›  How Does It Work? 

âœ¨ Main Components of the Code:

ðŸ”¹ Creating the main window & basic settings:

x = Tk() x.title("Supplications of the Week") x.geometry("400x210") x.resizable(False, False) 

ðŸ”¹ Displaying a message when a button is clicked:

def fb1(): messagebox.showinfo("Monday Supplication", "Supplication Text") b1 = Button(text="Monday", command=fb1) 

ðŸ”¸ Exit button:

b8 = Button(text="Exit", command=x.destroy) 

ðŸ”¹ Adding the signature label:

Label(x, text="Programmed by Me! GitHub: my_link_here") 

ðŸ”¸ Running the application:

x.mainloop() âœ… A Simple Yet Fun Program! 

At first, I made it just to cheer up my friend. But once it was done, I actually liked it myself! ðŸ˜‚

ðŸ’¡ What did I do next? 

âœ… Created an EXE file so it runs without needing Python installedâ€”now it's a real standalone app!
âœ… Sent it to my friend to show him what I made for him. His reaction? Priceless! ðŸ˜‚

ðŸš€ Final Outcome? 

A prank that started with someone leaving a group chat ended up inspiring a cool little project! ðŸ˜ƒ

Not only did I learn how to work with Tkinter, but I also made a fun memory that Iâ€™ll always remember! ðŸ¥°
